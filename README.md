## Problem Statement
In many colleges, there is a lack of awareness about research papers, and teachers often struggle to share their research work or projects with students. This absence of a dedicated platform hinders collaboration between students and teachers, preventing them from coming together to work on innovative projects. For instance, a Bio Tech student might not be aware of the research being conducted by Computer Science teachers, limiting opportunities for interdisciplinary collaboration.
 	
## Proposed solution
We have come up with a solution to a problem: creating a user-friendly platform where people can easily share their research work or projects. Our platform allows researchers and students to collaborate by liking, commenting, and applying to projects. We have also designed user profiles that show how well they are doing, which motivates them to be more productive and recognized.

## Get started with this web application

The web application should automatically open in your default browser.
By following these steps, you should be able to successfully set up and run the web application on your local machine.

## Technologies used
The technologies utilized for this project include 
1. MongoDB- I have used mongoDB as the database for this project because of it's following features
    - Flexible data modelling
    - Powerful query language
    - Vertical & horizontal Scalability
2. ExpressJS- I have used expressJS to create REST API's for college colab. Express.js simplifies building APIs by providing a minimalistic and intuitive framework with a straightforward and easy-to-understand syntax. Here are a few ways in which Express.js simplifies API development 
    - Routing
    - Middleware
    - Request and Response Handling
3. React- I used React for my project because it offers several advantages for building user interfaces. Here are the reasons why I chose React and why it stands out compared to other frameworks:
    - Component-Based Approach
    - Unidirectional Data Flow
    - Building Cross-Platform Mobile Apps
    - Virtual DOM
4. NodeJS- NodeJS is used to run JS on server side. It uses an event-driven architecture, which means it can efficiently handle multiple tasks and respond to events in a non-blocking way. Node.js has a vast ecosystem of libraries that significantly enhance its functionality and provide developers with ready-to-use solutions for various tasks.

## To Do Ideas
1. Create a profile page to create a healthy competition.
   - Number of posts, Number of projects completed
   - About, Bio, Skill set
   - Resume
2. Add deadline in the post such that you can tell weather it is active or not.
3. Add a feature through which user who creates the post would be able to see who has applied with there profile page link. Profile page will contain all the important and relevant information about applier like resume, skill, previous and ongoing papers/project.
4. User who creates the post will appear a list of applied users. Now the creator can select the users and create whatsapp groups throught the website which will add all the applieres or selected candidates into there profile. Notifications will also be sent to them. Apply would be a simple form why do you want to apply, skill etc.
